# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ House Prices Dataset
Introduction
The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis techniques using Python and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way. This involves generating a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab to explore the given dataset. The tasks include ingesting, cleaning, transforming (wrangling), summarizing, and visualizing the data.

Dataset
The dataset describes the sale of individual residential properties from 2006 to 2010 in a small town in the USA. Note that this dataset contains some mock-up data.

Project Tasks
1. Ingest Data: Load the dataset into the Jupyter notebook.
2. Clean Data: Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
3. Transform Data: Perform necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
4. Summarize Data: Use summary statistics to understand the data.
5. Visualize Data: Create visualizations to explore and present the data.

Focus
This project focuses on understanding, cleaning, and wrangling the data, and exploring it using summary statistics and visualizations. Formal modeling (regression, machine learning, etc.) is not included.

Documentation
All processing steps and meaningful information extracted from the data are appropriately documented within the Jupyter notebook.
